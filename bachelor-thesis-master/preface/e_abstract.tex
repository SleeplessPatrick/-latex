%With the rapid development of Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) in recent years, closed-loop detection has become a key issue and research hotspot in the field of mobile robot navigation. Closed-loop detection is essentially like a classification problem. In view of the superior performance of deep convolutional neural networks in image classification and image retrieval tasks, this paper proposes a network model structure based on convolutional neural networks and VLAD, which is used as a A new visual SLAM closed-loop detection method.

%This article first introduces the research status of visual SLAM, including the research progress of visual SLAM based on filter and graph optimization. Next, the research status of closed-loop detection as an important part of visual SLAM is introduced in detail, including the domestic and foreign research status of closed-loop detection based on artificial design features and deep learning.

%Secondly, this article analyzes the basic theory of visual SLAM and details the overall process of VSLAM. The process and different implementation methods of closed-loop detection in visual SLAM are summarized, the constituent modules of closed-loop detection of visual SLAM are refined, and the existing implementation methods and deficiencies of different modules are explored.

%Then this paper studies the feature point detection algorithm, analyzes and compares the SIFT, SURF and ORB feature descriptor methods. For the scene image description module of visual SLAM closed-loop detection, the image description based on traditional features and deep learning and their existing problems are deeply analyzed, and then combined with the characteristics of neural networks and VLAD features, a feature extraction based on fusion VGG16 network and NetVLAD features is proposed. The network model framework introduces the model's weakly supervised training process and the calculation of the loss function, and gives an experimental closed-loop detection method: using cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between the feature vectors extracted by the model and construct a similarity matrix To determine whether a closed loop is formed by comparing thresholds.

%Finally, this paper compares the closed-loop detection method based on the VGG16-NetVLAD network model with the traditional word-bag model closed-loop detection method and the closed-loop detection method based solely on the VGG16 convolutional neural network on the datasets New College and City Center. The experimental results are analyzed, and the experimental results show that the VGG16-NetVLAD network model has relatively good performance in PR performance and feature extraction time performance in closed-loop detection.
